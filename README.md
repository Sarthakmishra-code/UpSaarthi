# UpSaarthi

**UpSaarthi** is a trust-based, AI-assisted mentorship and professional guidance platform that helps people navigate real-world problems with the support of verified human experts.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To build a scalable ecosystem where **human expertise is amplified by AI**, enabling faster, reliable, and accountable guidance for learning, careers, startups, and professional decision-making.

## 🧭 What Does “UpSaarthi” Mean?

- **Up** → Growth, progress, upward movement  
- **Saarthi** → Guide, navigator  

**UpSaarthi = A guide for upward growth**

---

## 🧠 Core Problem

Real-world problems often don’t need instant execution — they need:
- Experienced judgment
- Context-aware guidance
- Trustworthy human input

Existing platforms either:
- Rely too much on AI  
- Are unverified marketplaces  
- Or are informal and unaccountable  

UpSaarthi solves this gap.

---

## 🎯 Initial Focus (Starting Niche)

- **Students & early-career professionals**
- Working on:
  - Real-world projects
  - Career decisions
  - Technical or domain-specific challenges
- Who need **mentorship, reviews, or direction**, not just answers

This niche ensures early trust, clarity, and strong adoption.

## 🤖 Role of AI (Clear & Pitch-Ready)

AI in UpSaarthi acts as an **assistive intelligence layer**, not a replacement for humans.

### AI is used for:
- **Intent & Query Classification**
  - Understands what the user needs (mentorship, review, advice)

- **Expert Matching**
  - Recommends the most relevant mentors based on skills, experience, and availability

- **Verification Assistance**
  - Extracts and analyzes resumes, profiles, and credentials
  - Flags inconsistencies for **human verification**

- **Load & Quality Management**
  - Ensures experts (especially retired professionals) receive meaningful, manageable requests

➡️ **Final decisions, trust approvals, and guidance remain human-led.**
